Unit 6: Inheritance Review

Superclass (Parent Class) ------->   Subclass (Child Class)

ex) Post (superclass) -----> MessagePost (subclass)

public class MessagePost extends Post

How to verify if a class is a good subclass?  "is-a"

Constructors:
-> "Parent comes first"
-> The first call in the constructor must be super which directly calls the
parent class
-> If no super call is made, java will try to call the default constructor,
aka super()
-> After you create the Parent Class then you would set the fields for
the subclass

Methods in the Subclass:
-> If you are in a method called roll() but you want to access the roll()
method from the superclass you would then say super.roll()

Object Class:
-> Every class extends the Object Class (Java does this for you)
-> toString() and equals() methods come from this class and if you don't change
them then they will be referencing where the object is in memory.

Polymorphism:
Hero app = new Superhero("Batman", 50);
**You are allowed to declare a variable of the superclass but instantiate it as the subclass**

Remember: At compile time you are a Hero, but at runtime you are a Superhero


ex) app.powerUp(20);
**You need to make sure powerUp is in the Hero class to compile, but when the program runs, it calls the method from Superhero

**if powerUp is not in the Hero class, but it is in Superhero, we can downcast the object.
((Superhero)app).powerUp(20);
